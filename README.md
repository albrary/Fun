# Welcome to My Library
This folder is a list of the silly projects I've made. None of them do anything for anyone, but they're fun to play with. Hopefully they'll become better over time.
I'll also probably try to build things that could help with what I want to do at work and in life. Mostly these will just be dumb pieces of code that could be done better by a highschooler.
