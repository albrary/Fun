# Welcome to My Library
This folder is a list of the silly projects I've made. None of them do anything for anyone, but they're fun to play with. Over time, I hope they become better. :)
I'll also probably try to build things that could help with what I want to do at work and in life. Mostly these will just be dumb pieces of code though that could be done better by a highschooler.
